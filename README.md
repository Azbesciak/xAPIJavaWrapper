# Java XTB API wrapper

This wrapper is a copy of [Java API Wrapper](http://developers.xstore.pro/api/wrappers.html) for XTB API, and released on github because XTB devs did not see the need for it (at least customer service said so).
*I have no rights to this code*.
Wrapper is freely available, the current version is *2.5.0*, and compatible with java, at least 8.

You can use this lib directly in your project, for example with gradle please attach in `build.gradle`
```groovy
repositories {
    ...
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.github.Azbesciak:xAPIJavaWrapper:2.5.0-1'
}
```
